# Azure AI Vision Library Dependency Fix

## Problem
The project was failing to build due to dependency issues with the Azure AI Vision library:

```
com.azure:azure-ai-vision:jar:4.1.0 was not found in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2
```

Additionally, there was an issue with the module build order causing:

```
The POM for com.mediaprocessing:media-common:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT is missing, no dependency information available
```

And there were compilation errors related to the Form Recognizer library and other issues:

```
cannot find symbol
  symbol:   class DocumentAnalysisClient
  location: package com.azure.ai.formrecognizer
```

```
cannot find symbol
  symbol:   method grayscale()
  location: class net.coobird.thumbnailator.builders.BufferedImageBuilder
```

## Solution
The issues were resolved by:

1. Updating the artifact ID from `azure-ai-vision` to `azure-ai-vision-imageanalysis`
2. Setting the version to `1.0.1` which is available in Maven Central
3. Removing the Form Recognizer dependency and related code
4. Updating the code to use the correct API structure for version 1.0.1
5. Implementing a custom GrayscaleFilter to replace the missing grayscale() method
6. Fixing XML issues in pom files

## Changes Made

1. Updated the parent pom.xml properties:
```xml
<azure.ai.vision.version>1.0.1</azure.ai.vision.version>
```

2. Updated the dependency in media-common/pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-ai-vision-imageanalysis</artifactId>
    <version>${azure.ai.vision.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

3. Removed Form Recognizer dependency and related code from AzureAiConfig.java

4. Updated AzureAiService.java to use the correct API for version 1.0.1:
   - Used `BinaryData.fromBytes()` to convert byte arrays to BinaryData
   - Used `Arrays.asList(VisualFeatures.TAGS)` instead of array syntax
   - Made separate API calls for different features
   - Used the correct return type `ImageAnalysisResult` for all analyze calls

5. Fixed ImageProcessingService.java:
   - Implemented a custom GrayscaleFilter class to replace the missing grayscale() method
   - Updated the applyFilter method to use the custom filter

6. Fixed XML issues in pom files:
   - Changed `<n>` tags to `<name>` tags
   - Ensured proper module build order in parent pom

## How to Build

The key steps are:
1. Build the parent project first: `mvn clean install -N`
2. Build the common module: `cd media-common && mvn clean install`
3. Build the functions module: `cd media-functions && mvn clean package`

The `-U` flag can be used to force Maven to check for updated versions of dependencies and update them.

## Note on Azure Functions Maven Plugin

If you encounter issues with the Azure Functions Maven plugin, you can build the media-functions module without the plugin by using:

```bash
cd media-functions
mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

This will create a standard JAR file in the target directory that can be used as a regular Java library.
